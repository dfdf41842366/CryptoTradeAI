## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Trade Analysis Logic:
```
For each scan result:
1. Calculate entry price (current market price)
2. Determine momentum direction (up/down)
3. Set 3 profit targets: 5%, 12%, 25%
4. Position stop loss at 8% risk
5. Calculate risk-reward ratios
6. Classify strategy based on float/volume
7. Recommend position size based on risk
8. Estimate holding period
9. Assign confidence score
```
